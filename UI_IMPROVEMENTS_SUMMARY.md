- Proper layout with action buttons on the right
- Student information display instead of showing current user

## Technical Changes

### Button Component Issues
The original shadcn Button component was using CSS variables that weren't properly defined, causing invisible buttons. Replaced with custom button classes using explicit Tailwind CSS classes:

```jsx
// Before (invisible)
<Button className="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-600 text-white">

// After (visible)
<button className="inline-flex items-center px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-600 text-white text-sm font-medium rounded-lg transition-colors">
```

### Card Layout Improvements
- Changed from multi-column grid to single-column for better readability
- Used flexbox layout with content on left, actions on right
- Added proper spacing, borders, and hover effects
- Consistent typography hierarchy across all cards

### Visual Enhancements
- **Emojis for icons**: More friendly and immediately recognizable
- **Color-coded status**: Different colors for different session states
- **Proper contrast**: All text now has sufficient contrast for readability
- **Hover effects**: Cards now have proper hover states for better UX

## Result

All button styling issues are resolved - buttons now have proper background colors and visible text. The one-to-one session cards now have a professional, consistent design that matches the quality of other components in the application.

### Before vs After:
- **Before**: White text on white/transparent buttons (invisible)
- **After**: Proper color contrast with blue/green backgrounds and white text

- **Before**: Small, cramped cards with poor information hierarchy
- **After**: Clean, spacious cards with clear information organization and prominent action buttons

The UI now provides a consistent, professional experience across all session management interfaces.
