# Schedule Page One-to-One Filter Fix

## Problem
When filtering by "One-to-One" session type on the tutor schedule page (`/tutor/schedule`), it was showing:
- "No sessions found"
- "You haven't created any Smart Quad sessions yet."
- "Create Smart Quad Session" button

This was confusing because:
1. One-to-one sessions aren't created by tutors, they're assigned by admins
2. The message and button were Smart Quad specific
3. There was no guidance on where to find one-to-one sessions

## Root Cause
The tutor schedule page fetches sessions from the `/sessions` endpoint, which contains sessions that tutors create themselves (Smart Quad, Masterclass). One-to-one sessions come from a different system - they're session requests assigned to tutors, available via `/tutor/session-requests`.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated No Sessions Message
When filtering by "One-to-One":
- **Icon**: Changed from üìÖ to üìñ (more appropriate for one-to-one sessions)
- **Title**: "One-to-One Sessions" instead of "No sessions found"
- **Description**: Clear explanation that one-to-one sessions are managed separately
- **Action Button**: "View One-to-One Sessions" linking to `/tutor/sessions`

### 2. Added Contextual Notice
When "One-to-One" filter is selected, shows a purple info banner explaining:
- One-to-one sessions are managed separately
- They're assigned by administrators when students request them
- Direct link to the dedicated one-to-one sessions page

### 3. Improved Other Filter Messages
Made the no-sessions messages more specific based on the session type filter:
- "All Types": "You haven't created any sessions yet."
- "Smart Quad": "You haven't created any Smart Quad sessions yet."
- "Masterclass": "You haven't created any Masterclass sessions yet."

### 4. Enhanced Action Buttons
- When filtering "All Types": Shows both "Create Smart Quad Session" and "View One-to-One Sessions" buttons
- When filtering specific types: Shows appropriate action button only
- One-to-One filter: Only shows "View One-to-One Sessions" button (since tutors can't create these)

## Code Changes

### File: `/app/tutor/schedule/page.js`

1. **Added notice banner**: Shows when `sessionTypeFilter === 'ONE_TO_ONE'`
2. **Updated no sessions logic**: Different messages and actions based on filter
3. **Improved navigation**: Clear path to one-to-one sessions page

### Key UI Elements:
- **Purple info banner** with ‚ÑπÔ∏è icon explaining one-to-one sessions
- **Context-appropriate messages** for different session types
- **Proper navigation buttons** leading to correct pages

## Result

Now when tutors filter by "One-to-One" on the schedule page:
1. ‚úÖ **Clear explanation** of what one-to-one sessions are
2. ‚úÖ **Proper navigation** to the dedicated one-to-one sessions page
3. ‚úÖ **No confusion** about creating vs. being assigned sessions
4. ‚úÖ **Consistent UI** with appropriate icons and colors

The schedule page now properly handles the conceptual difference between:
- **Sessions tutors create** (Smart Quad, Masterclass) - managed on schedule page
- **Sessions assigned to tutors** (One-to-One) - managed on dedicated sessions page

This provides a much clearer user experience and eliminates confusion about where to find different types of sessions.
