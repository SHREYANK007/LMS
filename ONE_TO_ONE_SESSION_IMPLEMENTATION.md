# One-to-One Session Implementation Summary

## Overview
Complete implementation of one-to-one tutoring sessions with Google Calendar and Google Meet integration.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Tutor Session Visibility
- ✅ **New Endpoint**: `/tutor/session-requests` - Tutors can now see all sessions assigned to them
- ✅ **New UI Page**: `/tutor/sessions` - Dedicated page for tutors to view their one-to-one sessions
- ✅ **Navigation Update**: Added "One-to-One" menu item in tutor sidebar
- ✅ **Session Stats**: Shows today's sessions, upcoming sessions, and total assigned

### 2. Calendar Integration for Both Users
- ✅ **Dual Calendar Events**: Creates events in BOTH tutor's and student's Google Calendars
- ✅ **Separate Event IDs**: Tracks calendar events separately for each participant
- ✅ **New Calendar Service**: `calendarService.js` handles multi-user calendar operations
- ✅ **Google Meet Integration**: Automatically generates Meet links for virtual sessions

### 3. Database Updates
- Added fields to `session_requests` table:
  - `calendar_event_id` - Main event ID (backward compatible)
  - `tutor_calendar_event_id` - Tutor's specific event ID
  - `student_calendar_event_id` - Student's specific event ID
  - `meet_link` - Google Meet URL
  - `calendar_event_link` - Calendar event URL
  - `scheduled_date_time` - Actual scheduled time

### 4. Frontend Updates

#### Admin Panel (`/admin/session-requests`)
- Added datetime picker for flexible scheduling
- Shows Google Meet link when available
- Success notification when calendar events are created
- Can override student's preferred time

#### Student Panel (`/student/one-to-one`)
- Displays Google Meet join button for assigned sessions
- Shows scheduled date/time
- Shows tutor information
- Calendar event link available

#### Tutor Panel (`/tutor/sessions`)
- New dedicated page for one-to-one sessions
- Shows all assigned sessions with status
- Quick access to Google Meet links
- Calendar integration
- Session statistics dashboard

## How It Works

### Session Request Flow:
1. **Student** requests a one-to-one session with preferred date/time
2. **Admin** sees pending request in dashboard
3. **Admin** assigns a tutor and optionally adjusts schedule
4. **System** automatically:
   - Creates calendar event in tutor's Google Calendar (if connected)
   - Creates calendar event in student's Google Calendar (if connected)
   - Generates Google Meet link
   - Sends email invitations to both participants
5. **Tutor** sees the session in their dashboard
6. **Student** sees the assigned session with Meet link
7. Both can join via Google Meet at scheduled time

### Calendar Event Creation Process:
```javascript
// When admin assigns tutor:
1. Get tutor and student user objects with Google credentials
2. Create session details object with time, subject, description
3. Call calendarService.createSessionCalendarEvents()
4. Service attempts to create event in both calendars
5. Returns Meet link and event IDs
6. Updates database with all event information
```

## Key Features

### For Students:
- Request sessions with preferred times
- View assigned tutors
- Access Google Meet links
- See session in their Google Calendar

### For Tutors:
- View all assigned one-to-one sessions
- Access student information
- Join sessions via Google Meet
- See sessions in their Google Calendar
- Dashboard with session statistics

### For Admins:
- Assign tutors to session requests
- Override scheduling preferences
- Automatic calendar event creation
- Track session assignments

## API Endpoints

### New/Updated Endpoints:
```
GET /tutor/session-requests - Get sessions assigned to current tutor
PUT /session-requests/:id/assign - Assign tutor and create calendar events
```

### Response Example:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Tutor assigned and calendar events created successfully",
  "request": { /* session details */ },
  "calendarEvent": {
    "meetLink": "https://meet.google.com/xxx-xxxx-xxx",
    "calendarLink": "https://calendar.google.com/event?...",
    "tutorEventCreated": true,
    "studentEventCreated": true
  }
}
```

## Error Handling
- Calendar creation failures don't block session assignment
- Graceful fallback if users don't have calendars connected
- Token refresh handled automatically
- Detailed error logging for debugging

## Testing Checklist

### Admin Testing:
- [ ] Create session request as student
- [ ] View pending requests in admin panel
- [ ] Assign tutor with custom date/time
- [ ] Verify calendar events created
- [ ] Check Google Meet link generated

### Tutor Testing:
- [ ] Connect Google Calendar
- [ ] View assigned sessions in /tutor/sessions
- [ ] Access Google Meet link
- [ ] Verify event in Google Calendar

### Student Testing:
- [ ] Connect Google Calendar (optional)
- [ ] Request one-to-one session
- [ ] View assigned session with tutor info
- [ ] Access Google Meet link
- [ ] Verify event in Google Calendar (if connected)

## Prerequisites
1. Google Cloud Console project setup
2. Calendar API enabled
3. OAuth 2.0 credentials configured
4. Environment variables set:
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI`
5. Users (especially tutors) connect Google Calendar

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Calendar events not created"**
   - Check if tutor has connected Google Calendar
   - Verify Google API credentials are correct
   - Check console logs for specific errors

2. **"No Meet link generated"**
   - Ensure `conferenceDataVersion: 1` in API call
   - Check Google Calendar API permissions

3. **"Tutor can't see sessions"**
   - Verify tutor role is set correctly
   - Check /tutor/sessions page access
   - Ensure session is assigned (not just pending)

4. **"Student calendar event not created"**
   - Student needs to connect Google Calendar
   - Check student's Google credentials
   - Verify token refresh is working

## Future Enhancements
- Email notifications for session assignments
- Recurring session support
- Session rescheduling with calendar updates
- Automatic reminders before sessions
- Session feedback and ratings
- Video recording integration
